Explanation of Code:
ðŸ”¹ if n <= 1: return False
Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime by definition.

ðŸ”¹ for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
We check for divisors only up to âˆšn instead of n for efficiency.

If any number in that range divides n, itâ€™s not a prime.

ðŸ”¹ if n % i == 0: return False
If n is divisible by i, then it's not prime.

ðŸ”¹ return True
If no divisors are found, the number is prime.
