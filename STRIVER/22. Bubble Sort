Outer loop runs n times to ensure the array is fully sorted.

Inner loop compares adjacent elements:

If the current element is greater than the next, swap them.

After each outer loop iteration, the largest element in the unsorted portion "bubbles up" to its correct position at the end.

Repeat until the list is sorted.
