arr=[10,5,5,12,6,7,19]
print(arr)
d={}
for item in arr:
      d[item]=d.get(item,0)+1
print(d)
explain the code logic

d = {}
d will store frequency counts for each number in arr.
The key will be the number, the value will be how many times it appears.

Loop through each item
python
Copy
Edit
for item in arr:
    d[item] = d.get(item, 0) + 1
What happens here:
d.get(item, 0):

Looks for item in the dictionary.

If it exists, returns its current value (count so far).

If it doesnâ€™t exist, returns 0 (default value).

Then we add 1 to that count and assign it back to d[item]
