n = int(input())

if n == 0:
    print(0)
elif n == 1:
    print(1)
else:
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    print(b)

_ is a throwaway variable since we don’t use the loop counter.
This loop runs for each Fibonacci position starting from 2 up to n.
b becomes the sum of the last two numbers (like in the Fibonacci definition).
a moves forward to take the old b’s value.


def fib(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)

n = int(input())
print(fib(n))
