class Solution:
    def reverseNumber(self, n):
        if n < 0:
            return -int(str(-n)[::-1])
        return int(str(n)[::-1])






 Why are there two colons [::-1]?
This is called slicing in Python.

 Basic slicing format:
python
Copy
Edit
sequence[start:stop:step]
start: index to start from

stop: index to stop before

step: how many steps to move (can be negative for reverse)
