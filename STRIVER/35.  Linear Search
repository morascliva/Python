# --- Example Usage ---
# solution = Solution()

# Example 1: Target found
# nums1 = [2, 3, 4, 5, 3]
# target1 = 3
# print(solution.linearSearch(nums1, target1))  # Output: 1

# Example 2: Target not found
# nums2 = [2, -4, 4, 0, 10]
# target2 = 6
# print(solution.linearSearch(nums2, target2))  # Output: -1
